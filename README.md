# DoomWads
This repository has all the WADs\PK3's that I've made so far.

Summary of all the WADs so far:
## idkfa.pk3 
This contains the script, which checks if you have used idkfa cheat while playing GZDoom source port. Once you do, the game will somewhat take the given message a bit literally by replacing rockets fired out of your rocket launcher with :joy: emoji. This won't affect Cyberdemon, all though I might make the version, which does affect it.
